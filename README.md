# Checkers Game
Checkers (Draughts) is a board game that you can play vs Computer or another Player (TODO)

# Algorithm Logic
Computer moves are calculated with a min-max algorithm with depth about 5, in that case, computer play moves that are best for every scenario in next 5 moves

# Info
I made a console version for a school project, but now I decided to create GUI and implement some more functionality
